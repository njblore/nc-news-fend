# Northcoders News Front End

Front-end for the Northcoders News API, built using React.
The interface allows users to create an account, log in as an existing user or a guest, post articles and comment on existing articles, and vote on articles and comments. Users can also update their user profiles with a new name or user avatar, and delete their own comments or articles.
